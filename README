Summary:
This is a simple python script that downloads public Flickr photos from configured groups.  I wrote it to periodically download wallpapers from groups on Flickr that upload wallpaper images.  

The script requires a Flickr API key and at least one Flickr GroupID, both values stored in a config file. When the script is run it will update the config file to include the last time it was run, and only search for images that have been added since the script was last run. The script has minimal error checking and is designed to be run by a cron-like interface periodically.

This script has parts lifted from flickr.py (http://code.google.com/p/flickrpy/) though large portions of the sript have been simplified/changed.

Installation:
Simply download and run with python v2.5+
